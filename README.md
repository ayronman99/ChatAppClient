# Simple Chat App

To use the app you need to clone the repo by typing in terminal:
 `git clone https://github.com/ayronman99/ChatAppClient.git`

After cloning the repo:

Type `yarn install` or `npm install`

This should install the required packages for the app. Next step is to run app after packages are installed:

`yarn preview`

This should load the app in localhost and you would see the sign-in screen.
